The media we consume has a massive impact on our thoughts, emotions and actions. This project, News and Snooze, sought to explore whether the news can have a noticeable impact on the quality of our sleep. This project had two sides: Sleep Monitoring and News Sentiment Analysis. 
The web app was created using the Flask framework and is hosted on Heroku.
